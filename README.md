A recreation of Joseph A. Weisbecker's FRED hobby computer from 1971


In 1970/71 Joseph A. Weisbecker built a hobby computer from standard TTL and nicknamed it FRED (Flexible Recreational & Educational Device). It had a video display, a cassette interface and a punched card reader. He demonstrated it to his bosses at RCA and eventually in 1975 it was integrated into a 40 pin CMOS chip, that is better known as the RCA CDP1802.

Fortunately, Weisbecker documented his project well, and full hand drawn schematics are available. A lasting historical document, now 50+ years old. Very few microprocessors from the 1970s began life as TTL prototypes and very few of the architectures are in the public domain.

I have taken these schematics and created a reproduction of the FRED CPU, that will run in the "Digital" simulator by H. Neemann - available here on GitHub.

It's a work in progress, and I expect to have to correct numerous mistakes. If you are an 1802 enthusiast or even a complete newcomer to CPU architectures, I hope that these simulation files will be of use to you.
